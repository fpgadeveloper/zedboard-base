zedboard-base
=============

Base project for the ZedBoard

## Requirements

This project is designed for Vivado 2020.2. If you are using an older version of Vivado, then you *MUST* use an older version
of this repository. Refer to the [list of commits](https://github.com/fpgadeveloper/zedboard-base/commits/master "list of commits")
to find links to the older versions of this repository.

* ISE Design Suite 14.7 or Vivado 2020.2
* ZedBoard

## Description

This project is a base system for the ZedBoard. The design contains only
the Zynq PS and is designed for and tested on the ZedBoard.

A tutorial for recreating this project in the Vivado GUI can be found here:

## Build instructions

To use the sources in this repository, please follow these steps:

1. Download the repo as a zip file and extract the files to a directory
   on your hard drive --OR-- Git users: clone the repo to your hard drive
2. Open Windows Explorer, browse to the repo files on your hard drive.
3. In the Vivado directory, you will find multiple batch files (*.bat).
   Double click `build.bat`. This will generate a Vivado project for the ZedBoard.
4. Run Vivado and open the project that was just created.
5. Click Generate bitstream.
6. When the bitstream is successfully generated, select `File->Export->Export Hardware`.
   In the window that opens, tick "Include bitstream" and "Local to project".
7. Select the `Launch SDK` option from the File menu in Vivado.
10. Generate a hello world application in SDK.
11. Connect and power up the hardware.
12. Open a Putty terminal to view the UART output.
13. In the SDK, select `Xilinx Tools->Program FPGA`.
14. Right-click on the application and select `Run As->Launch on Hardware (System Debugger)`

## Troubleshooting

Check the following if the project fails to build or generate a bitstream:

### 1. Are you using the correct version of Vivado for this version of the repository?
Check the version specified in the Requirements section of this readme file. Note that this project is regularly maintained to the latest
version of Vivado and you may have to refer to an earlier commit of this repo if you are using an older version of Vivado.

### 2. Did you follow the Build instructions in this readme file?
All the projects in the repo are built, synthesised and implemented to a bitstream before being committed, so if you follow the
instructions, there should not be any build issues.

### 3. Did you copy/clone the repo into a short directory structure?
Vivado doesn't cope well with long directory structures, so copy/clone the repo into a short directory structure such as
`C:\projects\`. When working in long directory structures, you can get errors relating to missing files, particularly files 
that are normally generated by Vivado (FIFOs, etc).
